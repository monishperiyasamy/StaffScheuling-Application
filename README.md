## üöÄ Dive into the Code  
To run Spectech locally on your machine, follow these steps:  

### Prerequisites  

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:  

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Spectech uses Java, so make sure you have the JDK installed. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.  

- **Node.js:** Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).  

- **MySQL Database:** Spectech relies on MySQL for data storage. Install and set up MySQL on your machine. You can download MySQL from [the official MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).  

**Clone the Repository:**

git clone https://github.com/monishperiyasamy/StaffScheuling-Application
  
### Frontend:  
**Navigate to Frontend:** cd frontend  
**Install Frontend Dependencies:** npm install  
**Run the Frontend Application:** npm start  
### Backend (Spring Boot)  
**Navigate to the Project Directory:** cd authenticate 
**Build and run the Spring Boot application:** ./mvnw spring-boot:run  
You can repeat similar instructions for each backend microservice, replacing "authenticate" with the respective folder names.  
### Database  
Create a MySQL database for Spectech. You can use a MySQL client or the command line to create a database.  

Update the database configuration in the backend. Open the application.properties file in the src/main/resources directory and configure the database connection properties:  

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name  
spring.datasource.username=your_database_username  
spring.datasource.password=your_database_password  

Replace your_database_name, your_database_username, and your_database_password with your actual database information.  
### Final Steps  
With the backend server running and the React development server started, open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000.    

You should now see and be able to interact with the Staff Scheduling application locally.  

## Project Overview:  
This initiative is driven by the goal of delving into the details of React.js and exploring frontend functionalities such as Redux and protected routes. Simultaneously, it provides an opportunity to engage with Spring Boot, master CRUD operations through REST APIs, and gain insights into microservices. The exploration encompasses various aspects, including communication between microservices, the implementation of JWT tokens, Spring Security, and the use of API gateways.
